    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "> - *Tool Output*: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",

      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI in healthcare is rapidly evolving, and there's always something new happening! Here's a rundown of some of the latest trends and developments:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Areas of Advancement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Discovery and Development:** AI is making significant strides in accelerating the identification of potential drug candidates, predicting their efficacy and toxicity, and optimizing clinical trial design. Companies are using AI to analyze vast biological datasets and molecular structures, leading to faster and more cost-effective drug development cycles.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** AI platforms are being used to discover new antibiotics and antivirals, addressing critical unmet medical needs.\n",
      "*   **Diagnostics and Imaging:** AI algorithms are becoming increasingly sophisticated at analyzing medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides) to detect diseases like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular conditions with high accuracy, often even earlier than human experts.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** AI tools are assisting radiologists in identifying subtle signs of disease, reducing misdiagnosis rates and improving workflow efficiency.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine and Treatment:** AI is enabling more tailored treatment plans by analyzing a patient's genetic data, medical history, lifestyle, and response to previous therapies. This leads to more effective and less toxic treatments.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** AI is helping oncologists choose the most appropriate chemotherapy regimens based on a tumor's genetic profile.\n",
      "*   **Predictive Analytics and Early Warning Systems:** AI is being used to predict patient deterioration, hospital readmissions, and the outbreak of infectious diseases. This allows healthcare providers to intervene proactively and prevent adverse events.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** AI algorithms monitor vital signs in intensive care units to alert clinicians to patients at risk of sepsis or cardiac arrest.\n",
      "*   **Robot-Assisted Surgery:** AI is enhancing robotic surgical systems by providing real-time guidance, improving precision, and enabling minimally invasive procedures.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** AI-powered surgical robots can assist surgeons with complex maneuvers, leading to faster recovery times and reduced complications.\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas for AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key new developments and trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a huge area. Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like those based on GANs, VAEs, or diffusion models) can **create entirely new molecular structures** from scratch. These models are trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties, and they learn the \"rules\" of chemistry to generate novel compounds with desired characteristics (e.g., binding affinity to a target, good pharmacokinetic properties).\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Companies are using these tools to design molecules that are predicted to be effective against challenging targets for which no existing drugs are available.\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Existing Leads:** Generative AI can also take a known promising molecule (a \"lead compound\") and suggest modifications to improve its efficacy, reduce toxicity, or enhance its absorption and metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** AI is crucial for sifting through enormous biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, patient data) to identify novel biological targets (like specific proteins or pathways) that play a critical role in diseases.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models can help predict whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning, can a small molecule or biologic be designed to effectively interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Accelerating Pre-clinical Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can rapidly screen millions or billions of potential drug candidates against a target in a simulated environment (\"in silico\"), dramatically reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are being developed to predict how well a drug candidate will work and what its potential side effects might be, even before it enters animal or human testing. This helps researchers prioritize the most promising candidates and de-prioritize those likely to fail.\n",
      "*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can help identify biomarkers that predict patient response to a drug, which is crucial for both drug development and personalized medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Advancements in Specific Disease Areas:**\n",

      "*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is being deployed to find new antibiotics and antivirals, especially in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Integration with High-Throughput Screening (HTS) and Automation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   AI is increasingly being integrated with robotic systems for automated drug screening. AI can analyze the results of HTS experiments in real-time and guide the next steps, creating a more efficient feedback loop.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **AI-Native Drug Discovery Companies:** Companies like Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Atomwise, and BenevolentAI are at the forefront, using AI as their core technology for drug discovery.\n",
      "*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are actively partnering with or acquiring these AI-driven firms to leverage their capabilities.\n",
      "*   **Sophisticated Algorithms:** Beyond generative models, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and advanced machine learning techniques are all being applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges Remain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these advancements, challenges persist:\n",
      "*   **Data Quality and Bias:** The accuracy of AI models heavily relies on the quality and representativeness of the data they are trained on.\n",
      "*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still require rigorous experimental validation in the lab and in clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Interpretability:** Understanding exactly *why* an AI model proposes a certain molecule can sometimes be difficult, which is important for regulatory approval and scientific understanding.\n",
      "*   **Integration into Workflows:** Seamlessly integrating AI tools into existing R&D pipelines requires significant effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, AI is transforming drug discovery from a largely trial-and-error process into a more rational, predictive, and efficient endeavor. We're seeing a significant acceleration in the pace at which potential new medicines are being identified and moved towards clinical development.\n",

      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the second development I mentioned in the drug discovery section: **AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a critical and often overlooked step in the drug discovery process. Before you can design a drug, you need to know *what* you're trying to affect within the body to treat a disease. This \"what\" is the biological target.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing target identification and validation:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenge of Traditional Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Vast Biological Complexity:** The human body is incredibly complex, with thousands of genes, proteins, and signaling pathways interacting in intricate ways. Understanding which specific component is malfunctioning in a disease state and is amenable to therapeutic intervention is a monumental task.\n",
      "*   **Data Overload:** Modern biological research generates massive amounts of data from various sources:\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** DNA sequencing data revealing genetic mutations associated with diseases.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA sequencing data showing which genes are active (expressed) in specific cells or tissues.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** Studying proteins, their abundance, modifications, and interactions.\n",
      "    *   **Metabolomics:** Analyzing small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Data:** Patient records, treatment responses, and disease progression information.\n",
      "*   **Hypothesis Generation:** Traditionally, scientists relied heavily on hypotheses, intuition, and manual literature review to identify potential targets. This process can be slow, prone to bias, and might miss novel, unexpected connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Transforming Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns, correlations, and anomalies within massive, complex datasets that humans might miss. Here's how it's applied:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Pattern Recognition in Omics Data:**\n",
      "    *   **Identifying Disease Signatures:** AI algorithms can analyze genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from healthy individuals and those with a specific disease. They can identify molecular signatures (e.g., a set of overexpressed genes or altered protein levels) that are consistently associated with the disease. These signatures can point towards crucial biological processes gone awry.\n",
      "    *   **Network Analysis:** AI can map out complex biological networks (gene-gene interactions, protein-protein interactions) and identify \"bottleneck\" nodes or pathways that are central to disease progression. Targeting these central nodes can have a more significant impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs:**\n",
      "    *   **Extracting Relationships:** AI can \"read\" millions of scientific papers and extract relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and existing drugs. This information can be organized into knowledge graphs.\n",
      "    *   **Hypothesis Generation Support:** By querying these knowledge graphs, AI can suggest novel hypotheses for drug targets. For example, if a paper suggests Gene X is involved in inflammation, and another suggests Protein Y interacts with Gene X and is linked to a specific autoimmune disease, AI can flag Gene X as a potential target for that disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n",
      "    *   **Structural Analysis:** AI can analyze the 3D structure of proteins to predict if they have \"binding pockets\" where a drug molecule can attach.\n",
      "    *   **Predicting Functional Impact:** AI can help predict whether modulating a particular target (e.g., inhibiting an enzyme or activating a receptor) is likely to have a beneficial therapeutic effect without causing unacceptable side effects. This involves analyzing data on similar targets and known drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Patient Stratification for Target Validation:**\n",
      "    *   AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups that are more likely to respond to a therapy targeting a specific molecule. This is crucial for validating a target – demonstrating that targeting it actually benefits a meaningful patient population.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of AI in Action for Target ID:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cancer Research:** AI analyzes tumor DNA and RNA sequencing data from thousands of patients to identify specific mutations or gene expression patterns that drive cancer growth. These are then flagged as potential targets for new therapies.\n",
      "*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** AI sifts through genetic data and brain imaging studies to uncover subtle molecular changes that precede the onset of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, pointing to new targets for early intervention.\n",
      "*   **Rare Diseases:** For diseases with limited research, AI can integrate data from various sources to uncover novel genetic links and potential therapeutic targets that might have been missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of AI in Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** Dramatically faster than manual methods.\n",
      "*   **Scope:** Can analyze vastly larger and more diverse datasets.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** Can uncover non-obvious targets and connections.\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** Helps prioritize targets, reducing wasted resources on less promising avenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI acts as a powerful magnifying glass and pattern detector, helping researchers navigate the overwhelming complexity of biology to pinpoint the most promising points of intervention for new medicines.\n",
      "\n",
